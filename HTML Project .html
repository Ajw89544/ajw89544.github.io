	<H1>My Trip to Taiwan and Thailand</h1>
	<Center><img src="TaiwanM.jpg" width="200" height="200"></Center>
	<h3>How It All Started</h3>
	<p>During my second year of college, two of my best friends decided that we wanted to do something fun together during the summer. I had never been out of the country and one of my friends, Brandi, has family in Taiwan. We all jokingly said that we should all go together. Soon after that, we were buying our plane tickets to Taiwan and Thailand and saving up money that we would spend while we were there. Finally, after stressing that I would not have enough money to take with me and working open to close and my job in order to get the money, the day came that we left for our flight and we all met at the airport at 5 a.m. </p>
	<h3>The Flight</H3>
	<p>The flight was <big>23 hours total</big> with two layovers. Our first flight was from Atlanta to Dallas and it was four hours long. The next flight was from Dallas to Tokyo and it was 13 hours long. And the last flight was from Tokyo to Taipei and it was around 6 hours long. On the plane, we all just watched tons of movies, ate bad airplane food, and talked about what we would do on our trip.</p>

	<h3>Taiwan</h3>
	<p>When we got to Taiwan, it was around 3 a.m. local time and we were exhausted and hungry form flying. We got to the airport and my friend had her uncle met us there to pick us up where we stayed at his house overnight. In the morning, we had traditional Taiwan breakfast from a restaurant on the street, and we were picked up by another uncle whose house we would stay at for the remainder of the time in Taiwan. Throughout the week, we went shopping, went to hot springs, rode the subway, had tons of great food, visited mountains and smaller towns around Taipei, went clubbing, and even got piercings and the night markets. The photo below was taken at the Taipei 101 building. You can find the link below.</p>

	<h3>Thailand</h3>
	<p>The week in Taiwan went by very quickly and we soon went to Thailand. The flight there felt like nothing, and it was only about four hours. When we got there, we stayed at a beautiful loft apartment in Bangkok. The week in Thailand, we visited many temples, went to tons of malls, had great food, and even had a Thai-massage. </p>

	<h3>Back to Taiwan</h3>
	<p>After a week in Thailand, we went back to Taiwan for two days. At this point, we stocked up on snacks we wanted to take home with us and did all of our last-minute shopping with the money we had left over. Soon our time in Taiwan was over and we made our way back to the United States on another 23-hour flight. </p>
